Next I would like to visualize the 'inventory' of the player on a UI element. The idea is to create an InventoryVisualizerMonoBehaviour. This component should be able to listen to resource management changes. Specifically there should be a light-weight event system to which this component can subscribe to. Additionally this component can have a reference to the ResourceCollector (component) of the player which is also the IResourceCollector key it can use to specifically listen to inventory changes for this collector. The UI visualization should look as follows: A single bar (indicating the total carry capacity), each resource shows up as a percentage of the bar filled with a color that corresponds to that resource. It is possible to have multiple resource shown, they will just stack colors from left to right in the total bar, ordered based on (for now the names of the resources). Additionally, resource allocations (for transactions in progress) should show up as an additional color, equal to the resource color but then with alpha 0.5. For this we need an additional (sort of enum) that maps the resource enum to a color. Explain how to setup such a UI element with this functionality.
